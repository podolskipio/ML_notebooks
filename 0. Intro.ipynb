    "There are two main types of machine learning problems:\n",
    "- Supervised algorithms: the datasets used for these algorithms contain several features and have an associated label or target\n",
    "- Unsupervised algorithms: the datasets also contain several features, but no targets\n",
    "- Reinforcement Learning\n",

    "## Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Here an AI system is presented with data which is labeled, which means that each data is labeled with the correct label.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of supervised learning:\n",
    "- Classification: when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”\n",
    "- Regression: when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "Here the AI system is presented with unlabeled, uncategorized data and the system’s algorithms act on the data without prior training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Unsupervised learning:\n",
    "- Clustering: for example when we want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior.\n",
    "- Association: for example when we want to discover rules, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y\n",

    "## Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning the algorithm learns by interacting with its environment. The algorithm learns without intervention from a human by maximizing its reward and minimizing its penalty. \n",
